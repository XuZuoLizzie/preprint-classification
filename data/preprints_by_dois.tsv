Early Safety Indicators of COVID-19 ConvalescentPlasma in 5,000 Patients	BackgroundConvalescent plasma is the only antibody based therapy currently available for COVID-19 patients. It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19. MethodsThus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. ResultsThe incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%. ConclusionGiven the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Brief SummaryAfter transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 patients, the incidence of serious adverse events was <1% and the seven-day incidence of mortality was 14.9%.

The feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients: a pilot study	Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65x109/L vs. 0.76x109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials. Significance StatementCOVID-19 is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is warranted.

Clinical findings in critical ill patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Guangdong Province, China: a multi-center, retrospective, observational study	BackgroundIn December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. MethodsIn this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. ResultsForty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. ConclusionsInfection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.

COVID-19 in people living with human immunodeficiency virus: A case series of 33 patients	Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still scarce. This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population. Three out of 32 patients with documented outcome died (9%). However, 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases, indicating that there is no excess morbidity and mortality among PLWH with symptomatic COVID-19. All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen, and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.	Haerter, G.; Spinner, C.

First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients	As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo(R)) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.	Chen, H.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, L.; Huang, Z.; Gong, F.; Li, X.; Chen, Y.; WU, J.

Lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot retrospective study	ObjectivesThis study aimed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of hospitalized patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). MethodsIn this retrospective observational study, COVID-19 hospitalized patients were identified and divided into two groups based on the antiviral agents used during their hospitalization. Group-LR patients were treated with single antiviral drug of lopinavir-ritonavir. Group-LR+Ar patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol for antiviral therapy at least 3 days. Patients were assessed for different clinical outcomes. ResultsA total of 34 and 39 patients were identified for Group-LR and Group-LR+Ar, respectively. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir alone was not difference from lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol in overall cure rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (92.3% and 97.1%, respectively). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol led to a median time of hospital stay that was shorter by 1.5 days than group-LR (12.5 days vs. 14 days). The percentages of COVID-19 RNA clearance was 92.3 in group-LR and 97.1 in group-LR+Ar. The mean time of virus turning negative was 11.5{+/-}9.0 days in group-LR+Ar that were longer than group-LR. Treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol did not significantly accelerate main symptoms improvement and promote the image absorption of pulmonary inflammation. ConclusionNo benefit was observed in the anti-virus effect of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone in the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. More clinical observations in COVID-19 patients may help to confirm or exclude the effect of antiviral agents.	Lan, X.; Shao, C.; Zeng, X.; Wu, Z.; Xu, Y.	2020-04-29	10.1101/2020.04.25.20079079
An exploratory randomized, controlled study on the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol treating adult patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 (ELACOI)	BackgroundAntiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. MethodsOur study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. FindingsThis study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. ConclusionsLPV/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care.

Medical treatment of 55 patients with COVID-19 from seven cities in northeast China who fully recovered: a single-center, retrospective, observational study	BackgroundCOVID-19 is an emerging disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; no specific medication has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. MethodsThis single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth Peoples Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. FindingsAll 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96{middle dot}36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17{middle dot}5 days; four received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52{middle dot}72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13{middle dot}5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12{middle dot}72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16{middle dot}36%) with immunomodulators. InterpretationGiven the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.

Convalescent plasma treatment of severe COVID-19: A matched control study	BackgroundSince December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing mass morbidity and mortality. Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls. MethodsPlasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti-spike antibody titer of 31:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls. ResultsConvalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75[~]0.98; p = 0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients (log-rank test: p = 0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 [~]0.72); p = 0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33[~]4.67); p = 0.752). ConclusionsConvalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of discharged patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the Qinghai plateau	Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, a series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude. With efficient measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, no new cases were found in Qinghai Province for 60 consecutive days between Feb 6 and April 6, 2020. Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified. Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan. Seven patients were asymptomatic on admission. Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities. Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness. High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission. All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies. Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters. The strategies of early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and improve the cure rate. Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness and could benefit from convalescent plasma transfusion.

Epidemiology, risk factors and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a Swiss university hospital: an observational retrospective study	BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. MethodsThis retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. Results200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18{middle dot}5%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9{middle dot}5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score [&ge;]2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). ConclusionsThis study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.

Clinical Outcomes and Plasma Concentrations of Baloxavir Marboxil and Favipiravir in COVID-19 Patients: an Exploratory Randomized, Controlled Trial	BackgroundEffective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are still lacking. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. MethodsFavipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544). ResultsBaloxavir showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 {micro}M comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir didnt demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 {micro}M. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. ConclusionsOur findings do not support that adding either baloxavir or favipiravir under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.

Plasma concentration and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study	BackgroundThere is an urgent need of active treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Although efficacy have not been proven, lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily has been proposed as a treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19. Previously published cohorts showed Covid-19 is associated with major inflammation. To date, no data are available regarding lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentration and its safety in Covid-19 patients. MethodsReal-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective cohort study. ResultsOn the cohort of 31 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR 2.9-6.4), with regards to average plasma concentrations in HIV treatment. All except two patients were above the upper limit of the concentration ranges of HIV treatment. In this cohort, about one over four to five patients prematurely stopped lopinavir/ritonavir therapy due to a moderate adverse drug reaction, mainly hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders. ConclusionPatients with Covid-19 pneumonitis treated with lopinavir/ritonavir have plasma concentrations dramatically higher than expected. Owing to that high plasma concentration may be required for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, it appears that lopinavir dosage should not be reduced in the absence of adverse effect. About 80% of the patients well tolerated lopinavir/ritonavir therapy under these plasma concentrations. However, cautious is necessary as drug repurposing can be associated with a new drug safety profile.

COVID-19 in Iran, a comprehensive investigation from exposure to treatment outcomes	PurposeThere is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19). We present a comprehensive report of Covid-19 patients in Iran. MethodsOne hundred hospitalized patients with Covid-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and post-discharge follow-up were analyzed. ResultsThe median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), lymphocytopenia (74.2 %) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in CT scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom relapse, (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died. ConclusionThis report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with Covid-19. The most common presenting symptoms are non-specific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options. Finally, patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse.	Ashraf, M.

Clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan, China: A multicenter retrospective study	BackgroundThe mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1x109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases. ConclusionImported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account. SummaryImported and second-generation cases manifested less complications, lower fatality, and higher discharge rate than initial cases, which may be related to the shorter interval from symptom onset to hospital admission, younger age, and higher lymphocyte count of the imported and second-generation patients. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used as indicators for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was found in later chest CT images in more than half of the pneumonia cases and should be taken into account.

Clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain: results from the SEMI-COVID-19 Network.	BackgroundSpain has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. ObjectiveTo create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. MethodsA multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. ResultsUp to April 30th 2020, 6,424 patients from 109 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.1 years (range: 18-102 years) and 56.9% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.2%, 39.7%, and 18.7%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (86.2%) and cough (76.5%). High values of ferritin (72.4%), lactate dehydrogenase (70.2%), and D-dimer (61.5%), as well as lymphopenia (52.6%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.7%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (62.4%). 31.5% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.1%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.2%, 60-69 years: 9.1%, 70-79 years: 21.4%, 80-89 years: 42.5%, [&ge;] 90 years: 51.1%). ConclusionsThe SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.	Casas Rojo, J. M.; Anton Santos, J. M.; Millan Nunez-Cortes, J.; Lumbreras Bermejo, C.; Ramos Rincon, J.

Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis: A multicenter cohort study	BackgroundPatients with pre-existing cirrhosis are considered at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but the clinical course in these patients has not yet been reported. This study aimed to provide a detailed report of the clinical characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. MethodsIn this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we consecutively included all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis that had been discharged or had died by 24 March 2020 from 16 designated hospitals in China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings on admission, treatment, complications during hospitalization and clinical outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. FindingsTwenty-one patients were included consecutively in this study, of whom 16 were cured and 5 died in hospital. Seventeen patients had compensated cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common etiology. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, and direct bilirubin levels were higher in patients who died than those who survived (p= 0{middle dot}040, 0{middle dot}032, and 0{middle dot}006, respectively). Acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary infection were both the most frequently observed complications. Only one patient developed acute on chronic liver failure. Of the 5 non-survivors, all patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2 patients progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. InterpretationLower lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin level might represent poor prognostic indicators in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.

Non-severe vs severe symptomatic COVID-19: 104 cases from the outbreak on the cruise ship "Diamond Princess" in Japan	BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. MethodsThis retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. FindingsThe median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. InterpretationLactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management. FundingNot applicable. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched the PubMed database from its inception until March 1, 2020, for articles published in English using the keywords "novel coronavirus," "2019 novel coronavirus," "2019-nCoV," "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2," "SARS-CoV2," "COVID-19," "mass infection," "herd infection," "cruise ship," "Diamond Princess," "asymptomatic," and "subclinical." There were no published clinical studies featuring COVID-19 as a result of mass infection on board a cruise ship. We found published articles entitled "Characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Beijing" and "Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study," which compared patients with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19. However, none of the studies described potential markers for symptom onset or disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Added value of this studyWe present the differences in clinical characteristics of 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 as a result of mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were treated at Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital, Japan from February 11 to February 25, 2020. On admission, 43, 41, and 20 patients had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively, whereas 33, 43, and 28 patients were determined to have asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively, at the end of observation. During the observation period, 10 of the 43 (23.3%) asymptomatic patients on admission developed symptoms of COVID-19. Conversely, eight of the 84 (9.5%) patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 on admission developed severe disease during the observation period. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were initially asymptomatic on admission to the hospital and developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the observation period compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. The prevalence rates of consolidation on chest computed tomography (CT) images and lymphopenia were significantly higher in eight patients who developed severe COVID-19 during the observation period compared with the 76 patients with asymptomatic or mild disease at the end of the observation. Older age, consolidation on chest CT, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 28) than those with mild COVID-19 (n = 43) at the end of observation. LDH level might be marker for symptom onset in patients with COVID-19, whereas older age, consolidation on chest CT imaging, and lymphopenia are potential risk factors for disease progression. The current report findings will contribute to the improvement of clinical management in patients with COVID-19. Implications of all the available evidenceSerum LDH level is a potential predictor of symptom onset of COVID-19, whereas older age, consolidation on chest CT imaging, and lymphopenia have potential utility as markers for disease progression.

Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 91 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang, China: A retrospective, multi-centre case series	BackgroundRecent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei. AimTo reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. DesignRetrospective case series. Methods88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. ResultsOf all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia. ConclusionsSocial activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.

Clinical features and outcomes of 221 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China	RationaleIn late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. ObjectivesTo study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methodswe performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main ResultsThe median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. ConclusionsThe COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China	BackgroundWith evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. MethodsA retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. ResultsCurrent standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

Effect of continuous renal replacement therapy on all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study	BackgroundFor the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), critically ill patients had a high mortality rate. We aimed to assess the association between prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation from February 12nd to March 2nd, 2020. All patients were followed until death or March 28th, and all survivors were followed for at least 30 days. ResultsFor 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 ({+/-} 10.8) years, and 30 patients (83.3%) were men. Twenty-two (61.1%) patients received PIRRT (PIRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed with conventional strategy (non-PIRRT group). There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings. During median follow-up period of 9.5 (interquartile range 4.3-33.5) days, 13 of 22 (59.1%) patients in the PIRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in the non-PIRRT group died. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated prolonged survival in patients in the PIRRT group compared with that in the non-PIRRT group (P = 0.042). The association between PIRRT and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant in three different models, with adjusted hazard ratios varying from 0.332 to 0.398. Higher levels of IL-2 receptor, TNF-, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, and NT-proBNP were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with PIRRT. ConclusionPIRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.

Favipiravir versus Arbidol for COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial	BackgroundNo clinically proven effective antiviral strategy exists for the epidemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). MethodsWe conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P>0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). ConclusionsAmong patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused Favipiravir are mild and manageable. This trial is registered with Chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2000030254).

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone: outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients	BackgroundCOVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes among patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. MethodsData was collected from electronic medical records for all patients being treated with admission dates ranging from March 2, 2020 through April 5, 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. Patients in the study were excluded if they were treated with other investigational medications. ResultsThe addition of zinc sulfate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation, or ICU duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulfate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulfate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744). ConclusionThis study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulfate in combination with hydroxychloroquine may play a role in therapeutic management for COVID-19. 40-word summary: Zinc sulfate added to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may improve outcomes among hospitalized patients.

No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial	BackgroundTreatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies. MethodsWe used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen [&ge;] 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. ResultsThis study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation. InterpretationThese results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARS-CoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia.

Chloroquine diphosphate in two different dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with severe respiratory syndrome in the context of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection: Preliminary safety results of a randomized, double-blinded, phase IIb clinical trial (CloroCovid-19 Study)	BackgroundThere is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. MethodsWe performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. FindingsOut of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dosage CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (18.9%), and a trend toward higher lethality (39%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate until day 13 was 27% (95%CI=17.9-38.2%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 27 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only six patients (22%). InterpretationPreliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations. FundingThis study was funded by the Government of the Amazonas State, Farmanguinhos (Fiocruz), SUFRAMA, CAPES, FAPEAM, and federal funds granted by a coalition of Brazilian senators. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBefore the CloroCovid-19 trial began, to our knowledge, there were no published reports of robust clinical studies on the safety and/or efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of COVID-19 during the recent 2020 pandemic. We searched PubMed and also MedRxiv.org (pre-print server for health sciences, without peer review), without any language restrictions and including Chinese publications, for studies published between Dec 2019 and April 5, 2020, using the search terms COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2. We found three non-randomized studies with limited sample sizes in which (1) HCQ use led to a decrease in SARS-Cov-2 detected in respiratory secretions five days after treatment, together with azithromycin (France, 36 patients); (2) HCQ use shortened time to clinical recovery (China, 62 patients); and (3) CQ was superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, and promoting virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course (China, 100 patients). We found no published studies comparing different dosages of CQ/HCQ and their thorough safety assessment. Added value of this studyIn a larger patient population, we found that a higher dosage of CQ for 10 days presented toxicity red flags, particularly affecting QTc prolongation. The limited sample size recruited so far does not allow to show any benefit regarding treatment efficacy, however the higher fatality associated with the higher dosage by day 13 of follow-up resulted in a premature halting of this arm. This is the first double-blinded, randomized clinical trial addressing different dosages of CQ for the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19 in the absence of a control group using placebo. Due to the impossibility of not using the drug recommended at the national level, we used historical data from the literature to infer comparisons for lethality endpoints. Follow-up until day 28 is ongoing with a larger sample size, in which long-term lethality will be better estimated. Implications of all the available evidenceThe preliminary findings from CloroCovid-19 trial suggest that the higher dosage of CQ (12 g total dose over 10 days) in COVID-19 should not be recommended because of safety concerns regarding QTc prolongation and increased lethality, in the Brazilian population, and more often in older patients in use of drugs such as azithromycin and oseltamivir, which also prolong QTc interval. Among patients randomized to the lower dosage group (5 days of treatment, total dose 2.7 g), given the limited number of patients so far enrolled, it is still not possible to estimate a clear benefit of CQ in patients with severe ARDS. Preliminary data on viral clearance in respiratory secretions in our confirmed cases are also indicative of little effect of the drug at high dosage. More studies initiating CQ prior to the onset of the severe phase of the disease are urgently needed.	Borba, M.; Val, F. d. A.; Sampaio, V. S.; Alexandre, M. A.; Melo, G.

Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with Covid-19	BACKGROUNDDespite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence. METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. RESULTSA total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONSIn this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.

Safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, in light of rapid wide-spread use for COVID-19: a multinational, network cohort and self-controlled case series study	BackgroundHydroxychloroquine has recently received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and is currently prescribed in combination with azithromycin for COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. MethodsNew user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%. ResultsOverall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) ConclusionsShort-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length. We call for caution if such combination is to be used in the management of Covid-19.

30-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the Italian epidemic: a prospective cohort study	BackgroundItaly was the first European country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has the highest number of recorded COVID-19 deaths in Europe. MethodsThis prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. ResultsForty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. ConclusionsCase-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20%. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine is associated with slower viral clearance in clinical COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease: A retrospective study	BackgroundThere is conflicting data regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients ObjectiveTo assess the efficacy of HCQ in increasing SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance DesignRetrospective observational study SettingCleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi ParticipantsHospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection InterventionNone MeasurementsThe primary outcome was the time from a confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab to turn negative. A negative nasopharyngeal swab conversion was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case followed by two negative results using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24 hours apart Results34 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Nineteen (55.9%) patients presented with symptoms, and 14 (41.2%) had pneumonia. Only 21 (61.8%) patients received HCQ. The time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity nasopharyngeal test was significantly longer in patients who received HCQ compared to those who did not receive HCQ (17 [13-21] vs. 10 [4-13] days, p=0.023). HCQ was independently associated with time to negativity test after adjustment for potential confounders (symptoms, pneumonia or oxygen therapy) in multivariable linear regression analysis. On day 14, 47.8% (14/23) patients tested negative in the HCQ group compared to 90.9% (10/11) patients who did not receive HCQ (p=0.016). LimitationsSmall sample size and retrospective design with a potential risk of selection bias ConclusionHCQ was associated with a slower viral clearance in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease. Data from ongoing randomized clinical trials with HCQ should provide a definitive answer regarding the efficacy and safety of this treatment.	Mallat, J.; Hamed, F.; Balkis, M.; Mohamed, M.

QT Interval Prolongation and Torsade De Pointes in Patients with COVID-19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin	BackgroundThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million affected and over 150 thousand deaths to date. There is no known effective therapy for the disease. Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). MethodsThis is a multicenter retrospective study of 251 patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. ResultsQTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to > 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 15.9% of patients. One patient developed TdP requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting QTc prolongation of > 60 ms was normal. ConclusionThe combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.

Preliminary evidence from a multicenter prospective observational study of the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19	BackgroundEffective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. MethodIn this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. ResultsA total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. ConclusionsAlthough randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating 102 the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: preliminary results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial	BackgroundChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methodsPatients were included in a single arm protocol to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasal swabs was tested daily. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. ResultsTwenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. ConclusionHydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.	GAUTRET, P.; LAGIER, J.

Hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial	ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus standard-of-care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in adult patients with COVID-19. DesignMulticenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants150 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone. InterventionsHCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone. ResultsAmong 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+/-} standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events. ConclusionsThe administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients. Trial registrationChiCTR2000029868 What is already known on this topic-- The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes substantial burdens on individuals, communities, health-care facilities, markets, governments, etc. globally. -- There is no specific treatment approved for COVID-19 or vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus. -- During the urgent pandemic, media headlines the utility of drugs without solid evidence but buries the side-effects of these drugs. What this study adds-- In this randomized clinical trial of patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19, exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability of virus elimination comparing to the current standard-of-care. -- Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal related, were significantly increased in patients who received hydroxychloroquine. -- Overall, the results from our trial do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.

Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose	Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 mol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality. Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.	Watson, J.

Experience with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for QT Interval Monitoring	BackgroundDespite a paucity of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected COVID-19. Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. MethodsWe performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazetts) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc [&ge;]500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc [&ge;]550 (if QRS [&ge;]120 ms) and b) increased QTc of [&ge;]60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. ResultsOf 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{+/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{+/-}29 ms and increased to 459{+/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{+/-}43 ms vs -0.2{+/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{+/-}39 vs. 0.5{+/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. ConclusionsOverall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients with these drugs should be carefully assessed prior to use.	Ramireddy, A.; Chugh, H.

Clinical Characteristics, Risk Factors and Outcomes Among the First Consecutive 1,096 Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19: The Kuwait Experience	BackgroundIn Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. FindingsOf 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the studys cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.To our knowledge, this is the first large retrospective cohort study observing the characteristics of the initial consecutive COVID-19 patients of an entire country. Further, large proportion of asymptomatic patients provides novel insights into the clinical features of patients with milder disease.

Negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR conversion in Response to different therapeutic interventions	BACKGROUNDDespite lack of convincing evidence of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, it has been suggested to be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 to accelerate the negative virus conversion. We aimed to explore the association between negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR clearance and different therapeutic interventions. METHODOLOGYThis was a retrospective cohort study of 93 patients who were admitted to medical ward with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and met the inclusion criteria in a tertiary hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. There were three interventional subgroups (group A (n=45): who received antimalarial drug only classified as (A1), combined with azithromycin (A2) or combined with antiviral drugs (A3)), and one supportive care group (group B) (n=48). The primary and secondary endpoints of the study were achieving negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR sample within five days or less from the start of the intervention and 12 days or less from the diagnose, respectively. RESULTSThe mean age of the patients was 43.9 years (SD:15.9). A median time of 3.00 days (IQR:2.00-6.50) needed from the time of starting the intervention/supportive care to the first negative PCR sample. There was no statistically significant difference neither between the percentage of patients in the interventional group and the supportive care group who achieved the primary or the secondary endpoint, nor in the median time needed to achieve the first negative PCR sample (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONPrescribing antimalarial medications was not shown to shorten the disease course nor to accelerate the negative PCR conversion rate.	Shabrawishi, M. H.; Naser, A.

Hydroxychloroquine and Tocilizumab Therapy in COVID-19 Patients - An Observational Study	BackgroundHydroxychloroquine has been touted as a COVID-19 treatment. Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. ObjectiveTo describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DesignRetrospective observational cohort study of electronic health records Setting: 13-hospital network spanning the state of New Jersey. ParticipantsPatients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Main OutcomesThe primary outcome was death. ResultsAmong 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. ConclusionsThis observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.

Neuropsychiatric adverse events of chloroquine: A real-world pharmacovigilance study using the FAERS database	ObjectivesAs of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database. Materials and MethodsWe conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model. ResultsWe included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. ConclusionCurrent pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.

Interim Analysis of Risk Factors for Severe Outcomes among a Cohort of Hospitalized Adults Identified through the U.S. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET)	BackgroundAs of May 15, 2020, the United States has reported the greatest number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally. ObjectiveTo describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. DesignCohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Setting154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states. Patients2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020. MeasurementsAge, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. ResultsNinety-two percent of patients had [&ge;]1 underlying condition; 32% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 19% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15% vasopressors; and 17% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and [&ge;]85 years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and [&ge;]85 years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not associated with either ICU admission or death. LimitationData were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded. ConclusionIn-hospital mortality for COVID-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.

Interferon-a2b treatment for COVID-19	BackgroundThe global pandemic of COVID-19 cases caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, with no approved antiviral intervention. We describe here the effects of treatment with interferon-2b in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. MethodsIn this retrospective study, 77 adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were treated with either nebulized IFN-2b (5mU b.i.d.), arbidol (200mg t.i.d.) or a combination of IFN-2b plus arbidol. Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing along with hematological measurements, including cell counts and blood biochemistry, serum cytokine levels, temperature and blood oxygen saturation levels were recorded for each patient during their hospital stay. ResultsTreatment with IFN-2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP. ConclusionThese findings suggest that IFN-2b should be further investigated as a therapy in COVID-19 cases.	Zhou, Q.; Wei, X.-S.; Xiang, X.; Wang, X.; Wang, Z.-H.; Chen, V.; Shannon, C.

Incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with targeted biologic and synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs	OBJECTIVESTo investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases receiving targeted biologic and synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) and to explore the possible effect of these treatments in the clinical expression of COVID-19. METHODSA cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. All patients had a successful recovery and only one patient required admission in the intensive care unit. When using the same classification criteria (only COVID-19 positive cases with pneumonia), COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONAdult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 suspected cases differs between tDMARDs.

Early outcomes of tocilizumab in adults hospitalized with severe COVID19. An initial report from the Vall dHebron COVID19 prospective cohort study.	BackgroundModulation of the immune system to prevent lung injury is being widely used against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite the scarcity of evidence. MethodsWe report the preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results82 patients with COVID-19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean ({+/-} SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non-Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) age-adjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1-4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5-11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7-11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS. ConclusionTime from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Our preliminary data could inform bedside decisions until more data from clinical trials becomes available. Summary of the articles main pointIn patient with COVID-19 and lung injury, time from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Early administration of host-directed therapies may improve patient outcome.

Use of siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support	BackgroundSevere COVID-19 is characterised by interstitial pneumonia and hyperinflammation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. Effective treatments are urgently needed, and IL-6 is a rational target to reduce hyperinflammation. MethodsAn observational, control cohort, single-centre study initiated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy included patients with COVID-19 confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA and interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Patients were treated with either best supportive care and siltuximab or best supportive care alone. Propensity score matching was applied to minimise differences in baseline covariates between patient cohorts. The main outcome was mortality in siltuximab-treated patients compared with patients in the matched-control cohort. This study (Siltuximab in Severe COVID-19, SISCO) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04322188. FindingsThirty patients received siltuximab, while 188 control patients received only best supportive care. Siltuximab-treated patients were matched to 30 control patients using the propensity score analysis of baseline covariates. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the siltuximab-treated than the matched-control cohort patients (HR 0{middle dot}462, 95% CI 0{middle dot}221- 0{middle dot}965); p=0{middle dot}0399). The mean follow-up was 33{middle dot}3 days (range 7-58 days) for the siltuximab-treated patients and 22{middle dot}8 days (range 2-45 days) for the control cohort. Sixteen siltuximab-treated patients were discharged from hospital, four remained on mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients died. InterpretationPatients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support may benefit from treatment with siltuximab to reduce mortality and cytokine-driven hyperinflammation associated with severe disease. These findings require validation in a randomised controlled clinical trial. FundingPapa Giovanni XXIII Hospital and the Italian Association for Cancer Research funded the study. EUSA Pharma supplied siltuximab, and provided funding for data collection, analysis, and development of the publication.

Negative impact of hyperglycemia on Tocilizumab therapy in COVID-19 patients	Tocilizumab is used for treating moderate-severe Covid-19 pneumonia by targeting IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) and reducing cytokine release, but the pooled rate ratio among diabetic patients with adverse vs those with the more favorable course was 2.26. To date, the hyperglycemia has been shown to increase IL-6 and IL-6R, which has been suggested as a severity predictor in lung diseases of Covid-19 patients. However, there are no data about the effects of tocilizumab therapy on outcomes of hyperglycemic Covid-19 patients with pneumonia. To investigate this unsolved need, 475 Covid-19 positive patients were retrospectively studied since March 1st, 2020. Among them, 78 patients with pneumonia disease and treated with tocilizumab were further evaluated for a severe outcome (encompassing both the use of mechanical ventilation and/or death). Thirty-one (39.7%) hyperglycemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycemic Covid-19 positive patients (blood glucose levels >140 mg/dl, at admission and/or during hospital stay) were evaluated. Noteworthy, 20 (64%) of hyperglycemic and 11 (23.4%) of normoglycemic patients were also diabetics (P<0.01). At admission, more elevated IL-6 levels in hyperglycemic patients were found and persists even after Tocilizumab administration. In a risk adjusted Cox-regression analysis, Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic did not attenuate the risks of severe outcome as did in normoglycemic patients (p<0.009). Therefore, we could conclude that reduced effects of Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic patients may due to the higher plasma IL-6 levels. Interestingly, when we added IL-6 levels in a Cox regression model the significance for the tocilizumab effect was lost (p<0.07). In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Profiling COVID-19 pneumonia progressing into the cytokine storm syndrome: results from a single Italian Centre study on tocilizumab versus standard of care.	ObjectiveApproximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or "cytokine storm". Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. MethodsBetween February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). ResultsIn the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8{+/-}10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p<0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. ConclusionHigher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key. FundingThis research received no external funding. Conflicts of Interest"The authors declare no conflict of interest." HighlightsO_LIThere is an urgent need for markers of prognosis in COVID-19. C_LIO_LIHigher inflammatory markers best select tocilizumab treatment. C_LIO_LIThe ward based tocilizumab group showed better responses and less infections than ICU tocilizumab group. C_LIO_LIThe former group may be the best for evaluating the impact of anti-cytokine therapy in COVID-19. C_LIO_LIThe known poor risk factors for COVID-19 infection were present in the TOCI treated rather than in the good prognosis standard of care group.

Early Short Course Corticosteroids in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19	BackgroundThere is no proven antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. MethodsWe conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. ResultsWe analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI [0.25 - 0.81]). ConclusionAn early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes. SummaryIn this multi-center quasi-experimental study of 213 patients, we demonstrate early short course of methylprednisolone in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients reduced the composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

A Randomized, Single-blind, Group sequential, Active-controlled Study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of α-Lipoic acid for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)	ObjectTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of -Lipoic acid (ALA) for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MethodsA randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days. ResultNine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P=0.09). ConclusionIn our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number.

Reduced mortality and shorten ICU stay in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia: a low PEEP strategy	BackgroundIntensive Care Unit (ICU) management of COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia is associated with high mortality. We implemented a care map, as a standardized multidisciplinary approach to improve patients monitoring using: uniform patient selection for ICU admission, a low-PEEP strategy and a pharmacologic strategic thromboembolism management. MethodsA standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance > 40 mL/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (< 40 mL/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O. FindingsFrom March 16th to April 12nd 2020, 41 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU from a total of 310 patients. 83% (34) of them needed mechanical ventilation. The ventilation approach chosen employed low PEEP value based on BMI (PEEP 11{+/-} 3.8 (10-12) cmH2O if BMI < 30 Kg/m2; PEEP 15{+/-} 3.26 (12-18) cmH2O if BMI >30 Kg/m2). To date, ten patients (24%) died, four (9.7%) received mechanical ventilation, two were transferred to another hospital and 25 (60.9%) were discharged from ICU after a median of nine days. InterpretationA multimodal approach for COVID-19 patients is mandatory. The knowledge of this multi-organ disease is growing rapidly, requiring improvements in the standard of care. Our approach implements an accurate pre-ICU monitoring and strict selection for ICU admission, and allows to reduce mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality. FundingNo funding has been required.	Ceruti, S.; Roncador, M.; Gie, O.; Bona, G.; Iattoni, M.; Biggiogero, M.; Maida, P.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Usage is Associated with Improved Inflammatory Status and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension	With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.

IL6 inhibition in critically ill COVID-19 patients is associated with increased secondary infections	BackgroundAnti-inflammatory therapies such as IL-6 inhibition have been proposed for COVID-19 in a vacuum of evidence-based treatment. However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infections. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. Results111 patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1% vs. 28.1%, p=0.029 and fungal (5.6% vs. 0%, p=0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2% vs. 19.3%, p=0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. ConclusionsExperimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.	Kimmig, L. M.; Wu, D.; Gold, M.; Pettit, N.

IMPACT OF GLUCOCORTICOID TREATMENT IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION MORTALITY: A RETROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED COHORT STUDY	ObjectiveWe aim to determine the impact of steroid use in COVID-19 pneumonia in-hospital mortality. DesignWe performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study. SettingA University hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020. ParticipantsPatients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. ExposuresPatients treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids. A propensity-score for steroid treatment was developed. Different steroid regimens were also compared, and adjusted with a second propensity score. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTo determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed, and adjusted including the propensity score as a covariate. Survival times were compared using a log-rank test. ResultsDuring the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) consecutive patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were assigned to the control cohort. Global mortality was 15.1%. Median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10 days (IQR 8 to13). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67], OR 0.51 [0.27 to 0.96], p= 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to no steroid treatment (RRR 0,42 [0.048 to 0.65). Initial treatment with 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone (or equivalent) versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42/310] versus 15.1% [13/86], OR 0.880 [0.449-1.726], p=0.710). ConclusionsOur results show that survival of patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia is higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids than in those not treated. In-hospital mortality was not different between initial regimens of 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent and glucocorticoid pulses. These results support the use of glucocorticoids in SARS-CoV2 infection. SummaryWe investigated in-hospital mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a large series of patients treated with steroids compared to controls, and adjusted using a propensity score. Our results show a beneficial impact of steroid treatment in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.	Fernandez-Cruz, A.; Ruiz-Antoran, B.; Munoz-Gomez, A.; Sancho-Lopez, A.; Mills-Sanchez, P.; Centeno-Soto, G.

Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Convalescent Plasma in Houston, Texas	BackgroundCOVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, and no proven treatments are available. Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for more than 100 years. MethodsPatients (n=25) with severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 - April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma obtained from donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had been symptom free for 14 days. The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 post-transfusion. Clinical improvement was assessed based on a modified World Health Organization 6-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters. Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains. ResultsAt baseline, all patients were receiving supportive care, including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral treatments, and all patients were on oxygen support. At day 7 post-transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged. By day 14 post-transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical status and 11 were discharged. No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed. The whole genome sequencing data did not identify a strain genotype-disease severity correlation. ConclusionsThe data indicate that administration of convalescent plasma is a safe treatment option for those with severe COVID-19 disease. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine its efficacy.	Salazar, E.; Perez, K. K.; Ashraf, M.; Chen, J.; Castillo, B.; Christensen, P. A.; Eubank, T.; Bernard, D. W.; Eagar, T.

Sarilumab use in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia	ImportanceInterleukin-6 signal blockade has shown preliminary beneficial effects in treating aberrant host inflammatory response against SARS-CoV-2 leading to severe respiratory distress. Objectiveto describe the effect of off-label intravenous use of Sarilumab in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. DesignObservational clinical cohort study. SettingFondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS as Italian Covid reference center. ParticipantsPatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<300 treated with Sarilumab between March 23rd - April 4th, 2020. Date of final follow-up was April 18, 2020. Main outcomes and measuresWe describe the clinical outcomes of 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia treated with intravenous Sarilumab in terms of pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards setting and of live discharge rate in ICU treated patients as well as in terms of safety. Each patient received Sarilumab 400 mg administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and was followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. No gluco-corticosteroids were used at baseline. ResultsOf the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39 (73.6%) were treated in medical wards (66.7% with a single infusion) while 14 (26.4%) in ICU (92.6% with a second infusion). The median PaO2/FiO2 of patients in the Medical Ward was 146(IQR:120-212) while the median PaO2/FiO2 of patients in ICU was 112(IQR:100-141.5), respectively. Within the medical wards, 7(17.9%) required ICU admission, 4 of whom were re-admitted to the ward within 5-8 days. At 19 days median follow-up, 89.7% of medical inpatients significantly improved (46.1% after 24 hours, 61.5% after 3 days), 70.6% were discharged from the hospital and 85.7% no longer needed oxygen therapy. Within patients receiving Sarilumab in ICU, 64.2% were discharged from ICU to the ward and 35.8% were still alive at the last follow-up. Overall mortality rate was 5.7% after Sarilumab administration: 1(2.5%) patient died in the Medical Ward whilst 2(14.2%) patients died in ICU, respectively. Conclusions and relevanceIL-6R inhibition appears to be a potential treatment strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab seems a promising treatment approach showing, in the short term, an important clinical benefit and good safety. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 infection remains a disease with many unknown aspects for which there are no therapies with proven efficacy. To date, it is recognized that COVID-19 disease may lead to the development of a cytokine storm for which drugs as IL-6R inhibitors may have beneficial effect. FindingsIn this observational clinical study, we reported the efficacy and safety of intravenous Sarilumab use in SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia with a global resolution rate of 83.0% (89.7% in medical wards and 64.3% in ICU) and an overall mortality rate of 5.7%. MeaningIL-6R-inhibition is an effective approach for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab is a promising treatment approach leading to an important clinical benefit and good safety in the short term.

Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19. A randomized clinical trial	Structured abstract for full paperO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAfter recovery from COVID-19, most patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. MethodsThe Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. ResultsThe trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. ConclusionMost COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with Convalescent Plasma in a mid-size city in the midwest	BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, has infected over seven million people world-wide, including two million people in the United States. While many people recover from the virus uneventfully, a subset of patients will require hospital admission, some with intensive care needs including intubation, and mechanical ventilation. To date there is no cure and no vaccine is available. Passive immunotherapy by the transfusion of convalescent plasma donated by COVID-19 recovered patients might be an effective option to combat the virus, especially if used early in the course of disease. Here we report our experience of using convalescent plasma at a tertiary care center in a mid-size, midwestern city that did not experience an overwhelming patient surge. MethodsHospitalized COVID-19 patients categorized as having Severe or Life-Threatening disease according to the Mayo Clinic Emergency Access Protocol were screened, consented, and treated with convalescent plasma collected from local donors recovered from COVID-19 infection. Clinical data and outcomes were collected retrospectively. Results31 patients were treated, 16 severe patients and 15 life-threatened patients. Overall mortality was 27% (4/31) but only patients with life-threatening disease died. 94% of transfused patients with severe disease avoided escalation to ICU care and mechanical ventilation. 67% of patients with life-threatening disease were able to be extubated. Most transfused patients had a rapid decrease in their respiratory support requirements on or about day 7 following convalescent plasma transfusion. ConclusionOur results demonstrate that convalescent plasma is associated with reducing ventilatory requirements in patients with both severe and life-threatening disease, but appears to be most beneficial when administered early in the course of disease when patients meet the criteria for severe illness.

Mortality reduction in 46 severe Covid-19 patients treated with hyperimmune plasma. A proof of concept single arm multicenter interventional trial	BACKGROUNDHyperimmune plasma from Covid-19 convalescent is a potential treatment for severe Covid-19. METHODSWe conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer [&ge;]1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. RESULTSThe study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, 30 on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26/30 patients and 3/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related). CONCLUSIONSHyperimmune plasma in Covid-19 shows promising benefits, to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. This proof of concept study could open to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, development of standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies.

Hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity - implications for COVID-19	SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe disease for which currently no specific therapy is available. The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.	Rother, N.; Yanginlar, C.; Lindeboom, R. G.

Early administration of lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study.	As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy. The aim of this retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started off-label treatment with LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020 was to compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started the treatment within five days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was also assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Grays test P = 0.213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment because of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r. The timing of the start of LPV/r+HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.	Giacomelli, A.; Pagani, G.; Ridolfo, A.

Effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients with COVID-19	BackgroundSome studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective drug in reducing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in vivo effect of HCQ still unclear. This study aims to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who underwent HCQ treatment in comparison with a control group that did not receive the drug. MethodsThis prospective study comprised consecutive viral load measurements in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with a moderate illness. Patients received 400 mg of HCQ every 12 hours for 10 days according to the medical decision. Nasal swab samples were collected at the 1st, 7th, and 14th days of the admission. Results155 samples were collected from 66 patients with COVID-19 (60% female), with a median age of 58 years. The viral load between studied groups, assumed as a semiquantitative measure of cycle threshold (Ct) values, presented no significant difference within the three consecutive measures ({Delta}Ct) (p>0.05). We also analyzed the {Delta}Ct viral load at different intervals of sample collection ({Delta}t <7; 7-12 and >12 days) without significant differences at any {Delta}Ct (p>0.05). ConclusionIn this study, we did not observe any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ. SummaryWe evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who took hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment and those who not. Prospective viral load measurements have shown any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.	Faico-Filho, K. S.; Conte, D. D.; Souza Luna, L. K.; Carvalho, J. M. A.; Perosa, A. H.

Tocilizumab shortens time on mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay in patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.	BackgroundHyperinflammation is a key feature of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a central role of the interleukin-6 pathway. We aimed to study the impact of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab on the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19. MethodsEighty-seven patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and moderate to severe ARDS were included (n tocilizumab = 29, n controls = 58). A matched cohort was created using a propensity score. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality, secondary endpoints included ventilation-free days and length of stay. ResultsNo difference was found in 30-day all-cause mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab compared to controls (17.2% vs. 32.8%, p = 0.2; HR = 0.52 [0.19 - 1.39], p = 0.19). Ventilator-free days were 19.0 (IQR 12.5 - 20.0) versus 9 (IQR 0.0 - 18.5; p = 0.04), respectively. A higher rate of freedom from mechanical ventilation at 30 days was achieved in patients receiving tocilizumab (HR 2.83 [1.48 - 5.40], p < 0.002). Median length of stay in ICU and total length of stay were reduced by 8 and 9.5 days in patients treated with tocilizumab. Similar results were obtained in the analysis of the propensity score matched cohort. ConclusionsTreatment of critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 with tocilizumab was not associated with reduced 30-day all-cause mortality, but shorter duration on ventilatory support as well as shorter overall length of stay in hospital and in ICU.

PLEXIT - Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for Covid-19 cytokine release storm (CRS), a retrospective propensity matched control study	PurposeTo evaluate the outcome of patients with COVID-19 triggered CRS treated with Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) as compared to propensity score matched (PSM)-controls not receiving TPE. Material and methodsUsing PS 1:1 matching, 90 patients were assigned 2 groups (45 receiving TPE and 45 controls). Forced matching and covariate matching was done to overcome bias between two groups. ResultsMedian age was 60 years (range 32-73 in TPE and 37-75 in non-TPE group), p= 0.325. Median duration of symptoms 7 days (range 3-22 days in TPE and 3-20 days in non-TPE), p=0.266. Disease severity in both groups was 6.6% moderate, 44.4% severe and 49% critical. Twenty-eight-day survival was significantly superior in TPE group (91.1%) as compared to PS-matched controls (61.5%), HR 0.21, 95% CI for HR 0.09-0.53, log rank 0.002. Median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in TPE treated group as compared to non-TPE controls 10 days and 15 days respectively (p< 0.01). CRS resolution time was also significantly reduced in TPE treated group (6 days vs. 12 days) (p< 0.001). ConclusionUse of TPE is associated with superior overall survival, early resolution of CRS and time to discharge as compared to standard therapy for COVID-19 triggered CRS. Highlights{square} Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology and progression to severe and critical disease in patients with COVID-19. {square}Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven effective treatment options (including Tocilizumab) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) {square}Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) may dampen CRS of COVID-19 by removing circulating cytokines and toxins {square}TPE is the cheapest of all novel treatments available so far to treat severe to critical COVID-19 {square}By intervening early with TPE, mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 triggered CRS can be reduced	kamran, s. m.; Mirza, Z. -e.

COVIDOSE: Low-dose tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid-19	BackgroundInterleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated hyperinflammation may contribute to the high mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody, has been repurposed for Covid-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in Covid-19 are lacking. MethodsWe conducted a phase 2 trial of low-dose tocilizumab in hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;] 40 mg/L who did not require mechanical ventilation. Dose cohorts were determined by a trial Operations Committee, stratified by CRP and epidemiologic risk factors. A range of doses from 40 to 200 mg (low-dose tocilizumab) was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24-48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Outcomes were compared with retrospective controls with Covid-19. Correlative studies evaluating host antibody response were performed in parallel. FindingsA total of 32 patients received low-dose tocilizumab. This cohort had improved fever resolution (75{middle dot}0% vs. 34{middle dot}2%, p = 0{middle dot}001) and CRP decline (86{middle dot}2% vs. 14{middle dot}3%, p < 0{middle dot}001) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration, as compared to the retrospective controls (N=41). The probabilities of fever resolution or CRP decline did not appear to be dose-related (p=0{middle dot}80 and p=0{middle dot}10, respectively). Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (15{middle dot}6%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (15{middle dot}6%) patients. Correlative biological studies demonstrated that tocilizumab-treated patients produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies comparable to controls. InterpretationLow-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Results of this trial and its correlative biological studies provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in Covid-19. FundingClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04331795. Study infrastructure was supported by NIH CTSA UL1 TR000430. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMany patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) develop acute lung injury and hypoxic respiratory failure possibly due to a hyperinflammatory state similar to the cytokine release syndrome that occurs as a complication of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in both processes, leading to the hypothesis that patients with Covid-19 may benefit from IL-6 axis-directed therapies such as the IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab. No dose-finding studies have been performed for tocilizumab in the setting of Covid-19. Added value of this studyThis prospective phase 2 clinical trial is, to our knowledge, the first to evaluate low-dose tocilizumab in patients with Covid-19 and the first to evaluate the effect of tocilizumab on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. Implications of all the available evidenceThe COVIDOSE study, together with retrospective and real-world evidence studies demonstrating the efficacy of tocilizumab, suggests that low-dose tocilizumab is a potential treatment for hyperinflammation among patients with Covid-19 and merits randomized, controlled testing in this patient population.

Clinical Outcomes With the Use of Prophylactic Versus Therapeutic Anticoagulation in COVID-19	BackgroundThis study is the first of its kind to assess the impact of preemptive therapeutic dose anticoagulation on mortality compared to prophylactic anticoagulation among COVID-19 patients. Its findings provide insight to clinicians regarding the management of COVID-19, particularly with the known prothrombotic state. Research QuestionTo determine the impact of anticoagulation on in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 positive patients with the a priori hypothesis that there would be a lower risk of in-hospital mortality with use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic dose enoxaparin or heparin. Study Design and MethodsO_ST_ABSStudy DesignC_ST_ABSRetrospective cohort study from April 1 - April 25, 2020. The date of final follow-up was June 12, 2020. SettingTwo large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut. ParticipantFive hundred and one inpatients were identified after discharge as 18 years or older and positive for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample size included 374 patients after applying exclusion criteria. Demographic variables were collected via hospital billing inquiries, while the clinical variables were abstracted from patients medical records. ExposurePreemptive enoxaparin or heparin at a therapeutic or prophylactic dose. Main OutcomIn-hospital mortality. ResultsWhen comparing preemptive therapeutic to prophylactic anticoagulation through multi-variable analysis, risk of in-hospital mortality was 2.3 times greater in patients receiving preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation (95% CI = 1.0, 4.9; p = 0.04). InterpretationAn increase in in-hospital mortality was observed with preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation. Thus, in the management of COVID-19 and its complications, we recommend further research and cautious use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic anticoagulation.	Motta, J. K.; Ogunnaike, R.

Efficacy and safety of interferon beta-1a in treatment of severe COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial	ObjectivesTo the best of our knowledge, there is no published study regarding use of IFN {beta}-1a in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial efficacy and safety of IFN {beta}-1a has been evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. MethodsForty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN {beta}-1a in addition to the standard of care. Each 44 micrograms/ml (12 million IU/ml) of interferon {beta}-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group received only the standard of care. Primary outcome of study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes duration of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects and complications during the hospitalization. ResultsAs primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 {+/-} 5.8 vs. 8.3 {+/-} 4.9 days respectively, P = 0.95). On day 14, 66.7% vs. 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group were discharged, respectively (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.05-6.37). The 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN then the control group (19% vs. 43.6% respectively, p = 0.015). Early administration significantly reduced mortality (OR = 13.5; 95% CI: 1.5-118). ConclusionAlthough did not change time to reach the clinical response, adding to the standard of care significantly increased discharge rate on day 14 and decreased 28-day mortality.

Tocilizumab and steroid treatment in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.	IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. MethodsThis observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). ResultsOverall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n=29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p=0.025. ConclusionEarly adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.	Mikulska, M.; Nicolini, L.

Safety and Efficacy Concerns of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in COVID-19 Affected Patients: A Retrospective Series	ContextOriginally developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the antiviral combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is being investigated for use against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We present a case series raising safety and efficacy concerns in COVID-19 affected patients. MethodsWe measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients treated at our center and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. ResultsCompared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV treated patients, concentrations in COVID-19 affected patients were 3-fold greater (20.64 +/- 10.14 mcg/mL versus 6.25 mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. The side effects noted were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12, 42%), electrolytes imbalances (4/12, 33%), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12, 42%), and triglyceride elevations (2/12, 17%). ConclusionNone of our patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and efficacy of LPV/r. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring for side effects and not necessarily attribute them to COVID-19 itself.

Effect of Systemic Inflammatory Response to SARS-CoV-2 on Lopinavir and Hydroxychloroquine Plasma Concentrations	BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to inflammatory cytokine release, which can downregulate the expression of metabolizing enzymes. This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). MethodsLPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12-hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. ResultsThe median age of study participants was 59 (range 24-85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4-10) and 8 days (IQR 5-10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 g/mL (IQR 18.9-31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. ConclusionsHigh LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV-2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung. CRP values significantly correlated with LPV but not HCQ plasma concentrations, implying inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism by inflammation.

Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French Intensive Care Units according to antiviral strategies. The COVADIS multicenter observational study.	BackgroundLimited data are available for antiviral therapy efficacy especially for the most severe patients under mechanical ventilation suffering from Covid-19 related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). MethodsObservational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or >0). ResultsWe analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having [&ge;]1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was frequent (64%), its incidence was different across the patients groups (P=0.01). In a post-hoc logistic multivariate regression apart from demographics characteristics and comorbidities, the use of L/R (administered to 81 of 376 patients was associated with occurrence of AKI (OR 2.07 CI95%:1.17-3.66) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). ConclusionIn this observational study of moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observed a benefit of treating patients with any specific antiviral treatment. We observed an association between L/R treatment and occurrence of AKI and need for RRT. Take home messageAny specific COVID-19 antiviral treatment is associated with higher ventilator free days at day 28 as compared to no antiviral treatment for patient in ICU under invasive mechanical ventilation. Lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury. TweetCOVID-19: Insights from ARDS cohort: no signal of efficacy for antiviral treatments.

Electrocardiographic safety of daily Hydroxychloroquine 400mg plus Azithromycin 250mg as an ambulatory treatment for COVID-19 patients in Cameroon.	ObjectiveTo determine the early electrocardiographic changes in a cohort of ambulatory cameroonian COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. DesignProspective study. SettingTreatment centres of the city of Yaounde, Cameroon, from May 7th to 24th 2020. ParticipantsWe enrolled 51 consecutive confirmed COVID-19 on RT-PCR who having mild forms of COVID-19 and treated by hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice daily during seven days plus Azithromycin 500 mg the first day and 250 mg the remaining 4 days as per national standard. Main outcomes measuresThe primary end-point was the change in QTc interval between day 0 (D0), day 3 (D3) and day 7 (D7). Secondary endpoints were changes in all other cardiac electrical conductivity patterns and the occurrence of clinical arrhythmic events during the course of treatment. ResultsThe population (29 men and 22 women) was aged 39 {+/-} 11 years (range 17 to 61 years). Mean Tisdale score was 3.35{+/-}0.48. No significant change from baseline (D0) of QTc was observed at D7 (429{+/-}27 ms at D0 versus 396{+/-}26 ms at D7; p=0.27). A reduction of heart rate was observed between the D0 and D7 (75{+/-}13 bpm versus 70{+/-}13 bpm, p = 0.02) with increased QRS duration between D0 and D7 (95{+/-}10 ms versus 102{+/-}17 ms, p = 0.004). No symptomatic arrhythmic events occurred during the treatment course. ConclusionsNo life-threatening modifications of the QT interval was observed in non-severe COVID-19 patients treated ambulatory with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Studies are needed in critical-ill and older patients.	Mfeukeu Kuate, L.; Ngatchou, W.; Temgoua, M.

Hydroxychloroquine has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 load in nasopharynx of patients with mild form of COVID-19	Due to the urgent need to stop the spread of the COVID-19 attempts to find the drug with anti SARS-CoV-2 effects among ones already available on a market are actively being made. A number of in vitro as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown that widely used compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is able to cause anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as treatment and prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity change in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found that most of the patients demonstrated gradual decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the swab regardless of the HCQ receiving. Noteworthy that patients with RNA load higher than 106 copies were hospitalized due to condition deteriorating significantly more frequently compared to those with RNA load below 106 copies even with HCQ administration. In addition, the results of the current study indicate that recovering patients may produce viruses at least during 18 days from the onset of symptoms and HCQ therapy does not block or reduce it.

A Multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hydroxychloroquine and a retrospective study in adult patients with mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	ObjectiveIn this study, we evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a retrospective study. MethodsSubjects admitted to 11 designated public hospitals in Taiwan between April 1 and May 31, 2020, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by pharyngeal real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, were randomized at a 2:1 ratio and stratified by mild or moderate illness. HCQ 400 mg twice for 1 d and HCQ 200 mg twice daily for 6 days were administered. Both study group and controlled group received standard of care (SOC). Pharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected every other day. The proportion and time to negative viral PCR were assessed on day 14. In the retrospective study, medical records were reviewed for patients admitted before March 31, 2020. ResultsThere were 33 and 37 cases in the RCT and retrospective study, respctively. In the RCT, the median times to negative rRT-PCR from randomization to hospital day 14 were 5 days (95% CI; 1-9 days) and 10 days (95% CI; 2-12 days) for the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively (p = 0.40). On day 14, 81.0% (17/21) and 75.0% (9/12) of the subjects in the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively, had undetected virus (p = 0.36). In the retrospective study, 12 (42.9%) in the HCQ group and 5 (55.6%) in the control group had negative rRT-PCR results on hospital day 14 (p = 0.70). ConclusionsNeither study demonstrated that HCQ shortened viral shedding in mild to moderate COVID-19 subjects.

Effect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: Preliminary results from a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial.	BackgroundHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of in vitro activity, uncontrolled data, and small randomized studies. MethodsThe Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We report the preliminary results for the comparison of hydroxychloroquine vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results1561 patients randomly allocated to receive hydroxychloroquine were compared with 3155 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 418 (26.8%) patients allocated hydroxychloroquine and 788 (25.0%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.23; P=0.18). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60.3% vs. 62.8%; rate ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99) and those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25). There was no excess of new major cardiac arrhythmia. ConclusionsIn patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality but was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.

Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A cohort study.	BackgroundSince the start of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, corticosteroid use has been the subject of debate. The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. ResultsOne thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001). ConclusionsTreatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine among Outpatient Clinical Trial Participants for COVID-19	IntroductionUse of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in combination with azithromycin, has raised safety concerns. Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. MethodsWe conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. ResultsWe enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred. ConclusionData from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19. Short SummaryData from three randomized clinical trials using hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 did not suggest significant safety concerns. Gastrointestinal side effects were common but arrhythmias were rare. There were no sudden deaths in any trial.	LOFGREN, S. M. M.; Nicol, M. R.; Bangdiwala, A. S.; Pastick, K. A.; Okafor, E.

A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease	BackgroundCurrent strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are limited to non-pharmacological interventions. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. MethodsWe conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. ResultsThe analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2% usual care vs. 5.7% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8% usual care vs. 18.7% HCQ). The incidence of AEs was higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (5.9% usual care vs 51.6% HCQ), but no treatment-related serious AEs were reported. ConclusionsPostexposure therapy with HCQ did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection in healthy individuals exposed to a PCR-positive case. Our findings do not support HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis for Covid-19.

Effect of tocilizumab  in hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia COVID-19: a cohort study	BackgroundTocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. MethodsIn a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2[&le;]96% despite O2-support [&ge;]6L/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 {+/-}15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 {+/-}4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n = 168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49 (95% confidence interval (95CI) = 0.3-0.81), p-value = 0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n = 246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR = 0.26 (95CI = 0.135-0.51, p = 0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p<0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. ConclusionIn this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.	Rossi, B.; Nguyen, L.

Tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The TOCIVID-19 phase 2 trial	BackgroundTocilizumab blocks pro-inflammatory activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6), involved in pathogenesis of pneumonia the most frequent cause of death in COVID-19 patients. MethodsA multicentre, single-arm, hypothesis-driven phase 2 trial was planned to study the effect of Tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints). A cohort of patients consecutively enrolled after phase 2 was used as a validation dataset. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate hypotheses, while controlling for possible confounders. Resultsout of 301 patients in phase 2 intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 180 (59.8%) received tocilizumab. With 67 death events, lethality rates were 18.4% (97.5%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4% (97.5%CI: 17.2-28.3, P<0.001) at 14 and 30 days. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, including 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. The multivariable logistic regression suggests tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. Also, it supports a positive effect on lethality rate of the use of corticosteroids. ConclusionsTocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Such result support the use of tocilizumab while waiting for ongoing phase 3 trials. RegistrationEudraCT (2020-001110-38); clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04317092)	Perrone, F.; Piccirillo, M.

Compassionate Use of Tocilizumab in Severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia. When late administration is too late.	IntroductionTocilizumab is an interleukin 6 receptor antagonist which has been used for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (SSP), aiming to ameliorate the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) -induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no data about the best moment for its administration along the course of the disease. MethodsWe provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. FindingsA total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases. At baseline, 114 (61%) required oxygen support with FiO2 >0.5 % and 72 (39%) [&le;]0.5%. Early administration of tocilizumab, when the need of oxygen support was still below FiO2 [&le;]0.5%, was significantly more effective than given it in advanced stages (FiO2 >0.5 %), achieving lower rates of intubation or death (13% vs 37% repectively, p<0{middle dot}001). InterpretationThe benefit of tocilizumab in severe SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia is only expected when it is administrated before the need of high oxygen support. FundingNone.

Effects of Tocilizumab on Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Cohort Study	BackgroundWhile there are no treatments with proven efficacy for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), tocilizumab has been proposed as a candidate therapy, especially among patients with higher systemic inflammation. MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. The primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit admission (ICU) or death. We used inverse-probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time-varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between tocilizumab use and the outcomes. ResultsA total of 1,229 and 10,673 person/days were analyzed. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between tocilizumab use and high C- reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.72, p=0.005) and ICU admission or death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.81, p=0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L, but not among those with CRP [&le;]150 mg/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. ConclusionsIn this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials and support the use of tocilizumab among subjects with higher CRP levels.

Observational Study of Haloperidol in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19	BackgroundHaloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potential effective treatment for Covid-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. MethodsWe examined the association between haloperidol use and respiratory failure at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Data were obtained regarding all adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19 since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. We compared outcomes between patients who were exposed to haloperidol and those who were not, using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. ResultsOf the 13,279 hospitalized adult patients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 667 patients (5.0%) were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 12,612 patients, 104 (0.8%) were exposed to haloperidol. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint of respiratory failure respectively occurred in 27 patients (26.0%) exposed to haloperidol and 1,700 patients (13.6%) who were not. Among survivors, the secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 26 patients (32.1%) who received haloperidol and 6,110 patients (55.3%) who did not. In the main analysis, there were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.97, p=0.772) and secondary (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.53, p=0.643) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. ConclusionIn this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, haloperidol use was not associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to hospital discharge home. These results suggest that haloperidol is unlikely to have a clinical efficacy for Covid-19.

Observational Study of Chlorpromazine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19	On the grounds of its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, chlorpromazine has been suggested to be effective treatment for Covid-19. We examined the association between chlorpromazine use and respiratory failure among all hospitalized adults with Covid-19 at the 39 Greater Paris University hospitals since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis adjusting for numerous potential confounders. We used a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Of the 12,217 adult inpatients with a positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test included in the analyses, 57 (0.47%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint occurred in 29 patients (50.9%) exposed to chlorpromazine and 1,899 patients (15.6%) who were not. In the main analysis, there was a positive significant association between chlorpromazine use and the outcome (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.56, p=0.019), while a Cox regression in a matched analytic sample yielded non-significant association (1.38; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.09, p=0.123). These findings suggest that chlorpromazine is unlikely to have a clinical efficacy for Covid-19.

Tocilizumab for treatment of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19	BackgroundSevere COVID-19 can manifest in rapid decompensation and respiratory failure with elevated inflammatory markers. This presentation is consistent with cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, for which IL-6 blockade is approved treatment. MethodsWe assessed effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). Findings154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.59 (0.36, 0.95)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. InterpretationIn this cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with a decreased likelihood of death despite higher superinfection occurrence. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan therapy with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 illness requiring mechanical ventilation? FindingsIn this observational, controlled study of 154 patients, receipt of tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in the hazard of death, despite twice the frequency of superinfection (54% vs 26%), both of which were statistically significant findings. MeaningTocilizumab therapy may improve survival in patients with COVID-19 illness requiring mechanical ventilation. These results can inform clinical practice pending the results of randomized clinical trials.	Somers, E. C.; Eschenauer, G. A.; Troost, J. P.; Golob, J. L.; Gandhi, T.

Tocilizumab is associated with reduction of the risk of ICU admission and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection	BackgroundIn some patients the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is unbalanced, presenting an acute respiratory distress syndrome which in many cases requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management worldwide; therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. ObjectiveWe aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. MethodsA retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. Results77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P= 0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0{middle dot}1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. ConclusionTocilizumab in the early stages of the inflammatory flare, could reduce ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation use. The mortality rate of 10.3% among patients receiving tocilizumab appears to be lower than other reports. Clinical implicationOur results suggest that tocilizumab administered to non-critically ill patients could reduce ICU admissions and mortality. Capsule summaryTocilizumab administered to non-critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the inflammatory flare, could reduce an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation use.

Temporal clinical and laboratory response to interleukin-6 receptor blockade with Tocilizumab in 89 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia	BackgroundEmerging evidence links morbidity and mortality of pandemic COVID-19 pneumonia to an inflammatory cytokine storm. MethodsEighty nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and heightened systemic inflammation (elevated serum C reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels) were treated with Tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor. ResultsClinical and laboratory improvement was seen comparing baseline and 1-2 day post-infusion indices. Among 72 patients not receiving mechanical ventilation, NEWS2 scores fell from 5 to 2 (p < 0.001) C reactive protein levels fell from 95 to 14 mg/L (p < 0.001) and lymphocyte counts rose from 900 to 1000/uL (p = 0.036). Sixty three of 72 patients were discharged from hospital, one patient died, and 8 remained in hospital at time of writing. Among 17 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, despite a rapid decrease in CRP levels from 89 to 35 mg/L (p = 0.014) and early improvements in NEWS2 scores in 10 of 17, ten patients died and seven remain in hospital at time of writing. Overall, mortality was only seen in patients who had markedly elevated CRP levels (>30 mg/L) and low lymphocyte counts (< 1000/uL) before TCZ administration. ConclusionsInflammation and lymphocytopenia are linked to mortality in COVID-19. Inhibition of IL-6 activity by administration of Tocilizumab, an anti IL-6 receptor antibody is associated with rapid improvement in both CRP and lymphocyte counts and in clinical indices. Controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the utility of IL-6 blockade in this setting. Additional interventions will be needed for patients requiring mechanical ventilation.	Formina, D.

Impact of tocilizumab administration on mortality in severe COVID-19	PurposeThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic has placed a significant burden on hospitals and healthcare providers. The immune response to this disease is thought to lead to a cytokine storm, which contributes to the severity of illness. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of tocilizumab provides a benefit in individuals with COVID-19. MethodsA single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. ResultsA total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; no tocilizumab=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the no tocilizumab group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died. ConclusionThe current analysis does not support the use of tocilizumab for the management of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19. Use of this therapeutic agent should be limited to the context of a clinical trial until more evidence is available.	Tsai, A.; Diawara, O.; Nahass, R.

Therapeutic effectiveness of interferon-alpha2b against COVID-19: the Cuban experience	BackgroundEffective therapies are needed to control the SARS-Cov-2 infection pandemic and reduce mortality associated with COVID-19. Several clinical studies have provided evidence for the antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in patients with respiratory coronaviruses. This study assessed the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-2b in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first month after the outbreak began in Cuba. MethodThis multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 16 hospitals in 8 Cuban provinces. Participants were patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection detected from throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol, that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-2b (Heberon(R) Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and non-detectable virus by RT-PCR). The secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. ResultsFrom March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 761 (93.4%) were treated with Heberon(R) Alpha R and 53 received the approved protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs 26.1%, p<0.01). The CFR for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-2b the CFR was reduce to 0.92. The estimated global CFR is 6.34% and 4.05% for the Americas reported by WHO and PAHO, respectively. In this study, 82 patients (10.1%) required intensive care and, of these, 42 (5.5%) were treated with IFN. ConclusionsThis report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon(R) Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery.

The association between treatment with heparin and survival in patients with Covid-19	ObjectivesThis study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19. MethodsRoutinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. ResultsAt the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR: 0.54(0.36-0.82) p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42 (0.26-0.66) p<0.001. ConclusionsThe association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required. - The administration of heparin was associated with lower mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19. - Our findings support that there is a thrombotic component in the development of respiratory distress for these patients. - The positive effect of heparin seems consistent and its use, when indicated, could be considered in clinical settings. - Randomized controlled trials are necessary to complement observational studies, and assess the causal associations between heparin, in different therapeutic regimes, and clinical outcomes. - Heparin is easy to administer, its use in ambulatory patients, to prevent admissions, or reduce their duration, could also be considered by clinicians and future researchers.

Effects of Anticoagulants and Corticosteroids therapy in patients affected by severe COVID-19 Pneumonia	BackgroundIn the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, the combined use of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either modality alone in the treatment of COVID-19. MethodsPatients hospitalized between April 10th, 2020, through May 10th, 2020, who had confirmed COVID-19 infection with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, in which 65 patients have moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, and 63 patients have severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received early combination therapy of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs. They assessed for type and duration of treatment, and days need to wean from oxygen therapy, length of stay, virus clearance time, and complication or adverse events. All patients had more than 28 days follow up after discharge from the hospital. ResultsModerate COVID-19 pneumonia group were 65 patients who received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50 (76.9 %) and female patients were 15 (23.1 %). 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%. All patients discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complications or significant complications. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia group were 63 patients who received methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55 (87.3 %) and female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and 31 (49.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on a non-rebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %) for 5 days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. Sixty-two patients discharged home with one patient had a long stay, and the other two transferred to ICU. One long-stay patient transferred to ICU on low flow oxygen therapy.

Multicenter point-prevalence evaluation of the utilization and safety of drug therapies for COVID-19	BackgroundThere are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. MethodsWe conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ResultsA total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p = 0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs. 3.2%, p< 0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR = 5.9, p = 0.028). ConclusionsWhile we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials. Comprehensive systems are needed to identify and mitigate ADRs associated with experimental COVID-19 therapies.	Rhodes, N. J.; Dairem, A.; Moore, W.; Shah, A.; Postelnick, M. J.; Badowski, M.

GLUCOCOVID: A controlled trial of methylprednisolone in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia	BackgroundWe aimed to determine whether a 6-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) improves outcome in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection at risk of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). MethodsMulticentric, partially randomized, preference, open-label trial, including adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, impaired gas exchange and biochemical evidence of hyper-inflammation. Patients were assigned to standard of care (SOC), or SOC plus intravenous MP [40mg/12h 3 days, then 20mg/12h 3 days]. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). ResultsWe analyzed 85 patients (34, randomized to MP; 22, assigned to MP by clinicians preference; 29, control group). Patients age (mean 68{+/-}12 yr) was related to outcome. The use of MP was associated with a reduced risk of the composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat, age-stratified analysis (combined risk ratio -RR-0.55 [95% CI 0.33-0.91]; p=0.024). In the per-protocol analysis, RR was 0.11 (0.01-0.83) in patients aged 72 yr or less, 0.61 (0.32-1.17) in those over 72 yr, and 0.37 (0.19-0.74, p=0.0037) in the whole group after age-adjustment by stratification. The decrease in C-reactive protein levels was more pronounced in the MP group (p=0.0003). Hyperglycemia was more frequent in the MP group. ConclusionsA short course of MP had a beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, decreasing the risk of the composite end point of admission to ICU, NIV or death.

Real-world Experience with Favipiravir for Treatment of COVID-19 in Thailand: Results from a Multi-center Observational Study	SYNOPSISO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSFavipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 is limited. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. ResultsAmong 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received [&ge;]1 dose of favipiravir. Of these, 27.0% required an O2-nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and/or high-flow O2-therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5(0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7%[53.7-78.0%] in all patients, 92.5%[75.7%-99.1%] in patients who did not require O2-supplementation, and 47.2%[0.4%-64.5%] in patients who required O2-supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement [odds ratio (95%CI); p-value]: older age [0.94 (0.89-0.99); p=0.04], higher baseline NEWS2 score [0.64 (0.47-0.88); p=0.006], and lower favipiravir loading dose ([&le;]45 mg/kg/day) [0.04 (0.005-0.4); p=0.006]. ConclusionsOur study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir ([&le;]45 mg/kg/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed.

Evaluation of Convalescent Plasma versus Standard of Care for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalazed Patients: study protocol for a phase 2 randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter trial	BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods/DesignThe ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The protocol has been prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to categories 5, 6 or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. DiscussionThis clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.

Dual-Histamine Blockade with Cetirizine - Famotidine Reduces Pulmonary Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients	BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as a result of a pulmonary cytokine storm. Antihistamines are safe and effective treatments for reducing inflammation and cytokine release. Combinations of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor antagonists have been effective in urticaria, and might reduce the histamine-mediated pulmonary cytokine storm in COVID-19. Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? MethodsA physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. ResultsOf all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine receptor blockade for at least 48 hours, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 hours of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited beneficial reductions in inpatient mortality and symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 inpatients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. ConclusionsThis physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm. Further clinical studies in COVID-19 are warranted of the repurposed off-label combination of two historically-safe histamine receptor blockers.	Hogan, R. B.; Hogan, R.

Tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Clinical outcomes, inflammatory marker kinetics, safety, and a review of the literature	BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a 6-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. ResultsWe evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced CRP, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in Cox models of time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias. ConclusionsTocilizumab did not improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, this study was not powered to detect small differences, and there remains the possibility for a survival benefit.	Hill, J. A.; Menon, M. P.; Dhanireddy, S.; Wurfel, M.

SSRIs and SNRIs and Risk of Death or Intubation in COVID-19: Results from an Observational Study	ObjectiveTo examine the association between antidepressant use and the risk of intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DesignMulticenter observational retrospective cohort study. SettingGreater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants7,345 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 460 patients (6.3%) who received an antidepressant during the visit. Data sourceAssistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measuresThe primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), disease severity and other psychotropic medications. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 18.5 days (SD=27.1), 1,331 patients (18.1%) had a primary end-point event. Unadjusted hazard ratio estimates of the association between antidepressant use and the primary outcome stratified by age (i.e., 18-50, 51-70, 71-80, and 81+) were non-significant (all p>0.072), except in the group of patients aged 71-80 years (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98; p=0.041). Following adjustments, the primary analyses showed a significant association between use of any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001), SSRI (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.75; p<0.001), and SNRI (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.96; p=0.034), and reduced risk of intubation or death. Specifically, exposures to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine were significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). These associations remain significant in multiple sensitivity analyses, except for the association between SNRI use and the outcome. ConclusionsSSRI use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed. What is already known on this topicO_LIA prior meta-analysis, mainly including studies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), showed that antidepressant use in major depressive disorder was associated with reduced levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-, and CCL-2, which have been suggested to be associated with severe COVID-19. C_LIO_LIA recent in-vitro study supports antiviral effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on SARS-CoV-2. C_LIO_LITo our knowledge, no study has examined the efficacy of antidepressants in patients with COVID-19. C_LI What this study addsO_LIIn a multicenter observational retrospective study, we examined the association between antidepressant use and the risk of intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, adjusting for patient characteristics, disease severity and other psychotropic medications. C_LIO_LIAntidepressant use was significantly and substantially associated with reduced risk of intubation or death. C_LIO_LIAt the level of antidepressant classes, SSRI use was significantly and substantially associated with reduced risk of intubation or death, but not other antidepressant classes.

Clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with high-titer convalescent plasma: a prospective study	OBJECTIVESTo determine the rate of intubation, overall survival, viral clearance, and the development of endogenous antibodies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with convalescent plasma containing high levels of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also aimed to describe the laboratory parameters of the plasma products. DESIGNThis was a phase IIa, single institution, prospective study in adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. SETTINGHackensack University Medical Center, a 770-bed research and teaching hospital located in Bergen County NJ, 11 km from New York City. The study was conducted between April 15 and June 18, 2020. PARTICIPANTS47 hospitalized adult patients were treated: 32 in the non-mechanically ventilated group and 15 in the mechanically ventilated group. All patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by radiographic and laboratory evaluation. INTERVENTIONFresh or frozen convalescent plasma from donors with high titers of viral neutralizing antibodies was administered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESIncidence of intubation, overall survival, and discharge rate of patients divided in cohorts based on severity of disease. Description of infused plasma characteristics. Evaluation of recipients pre-treatment viral immunity, immunity transfer from convalescent plasma administration, and late immunity 30 and 60 days after treatment. Rates of viral clearance by nasopharyngeal PCR at 10 and 30 days. Outcomes of patients with no pre-treatment immunity. Survival comparison with institutional data for each cohort. RESULTSAnalysis for the non-mechanically ventilated patients showed an intubation rate of 15.6% (95% CI: 5.3%-32.8%) and a day-30 survival rate of 87.5% (28/32; 95% CI:70.2%-96.4%). The overall survival for a comparative group based on institutional data was 66% (675/1023; p=0.012). The rates of negative nasopharyngeal swab by PR-PCR on day+10 and +30 post treatment were 42.9% (95% CI: 24%-63%) and 78% (95% CI: 56%-93%) respectively. Patients mechanically ventilated had a day-30 mortality of 46.7% (95% CI:21.3%-73.4%); the mortality for a comparative group based on institutional data was 68.5% (217/317; p=0.093). The rates of negative nasopharyngeal swab by PR-PCR at day+10 and +30 was 85.7% (95% CI: 42-100%; n=7) and 100% (95% CI: 63-100%; n=8). Seven patients (15%) had no pre-infusion immunity, and all were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers three days post infusion. All evaluable patients were found to have neutralizing antibodies on day+30 (n=30) and on day+60 (n=12) post treatment. There was no difference in outcomes within the ranges of high antiviral neutralizing titers used, mostly greater than 1:1000. There was also no difference between fresh or frozen plasma. The only adverse event was a mild rash in one patient. CONCLUSIONIn this study of adult patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, convalescent plasma was safe and conferred effective transfer of immunity while preserving endogenous immune response. Intubation rates, survival rates compared with institutional data, and viral clearance rates, support the continued evaluation of this antiviral modality.

Efficacy of Corticosteroids in Non-Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia from the New York Metropolitan region	IntroductionThe role of systemic corticosteroid as a therapeutic agent for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is controversial. ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). MethodsThis was a single-center retrospective cohort study, from the 16th March, 2020 to 30th April, 2020; final follow-up on 10th May, 2020. 265 patients consecutively admitted to the non-ICU wards with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were screened for inclusion. 205 patients who developed AHRF (SpO2/FiO2 [&le;] 440 or PaO2/FiO2 [&le;] 300) were only included in the final study. Direct admission to the Intensive care unit (ICU), patients developing composite primary outcome within 24 hours of admission, and patients who never became hypoxic during their stay in the hospital were excluded. Patients divided into two cohort based on corticosteroid. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU transfer, intubation, in-hospital mortality, discharge, length of stay and daily trend of SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio from the index date. Cox-proportional hazard regression was implemented to analyze the time to event outcomes. ResultAmong 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was [~]57 years, and [~]75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P=0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07 - 0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P - 0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P - 0.172), and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2/FiO2 over time. ConclusionAmong non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital death.

First Clinical Use of Lenzilumab to Neutralize GM-CSF in Patients with Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia	BackgroundIn COVID-19, high levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and inflammatory myeloid cells correlate with disease severity, cytokine storm, and respiratory failure. With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. MethodsHospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. All patients receiving lenzilumab through May 1, 2020 were included in this report. ResultsTwelve patients were treated with lenzilumab. Clinical improvement was observed in 11 out of 12 (92%), with a median time to discharge of 5 days. There was a significant improvement in oxygenation: The proportion of patients with SpO2/FiO2 < 315 at the end of observation was 8% vs. compared to 67% at baseline (p=0.00015). A significant improvement in mean CRP and IL-6 values on day 3 following lenzilumab administration was also observed (137.3 mg/L vs 51.2 mg/L, p = 0.040; 26.8 pg/mL vs 16.1 pg/mL, p = 0.035; respectively). Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells two days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab, and no mortality in this cohort of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. ConclusionsIn high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe and critical pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm.

Prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia	BackgroundIn hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. MethodsWe conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. ResultsFindings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 {+/-} 9.0 vs. 17.5 {+/-} 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). ConclusionIn patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov.

Therapeutic effectiveness of interferon alpha 2b treatment for COVID-19 patient recovery	BackgroundEffective antiviral treatments are required to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon-2b (IFN-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. MethodA prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. ResultsFrom March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon(R) Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. ConclusionsThis second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon(R) Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.
